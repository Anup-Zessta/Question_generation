# Question Generation

This repository aims to create code snippets with logical issues using different techniques and approaches. This can be useful for testing edge cases, creating debugging exercises, or experimenting with different code modifications.

### Post Processing with Deep-Seek Model

 **Logical Issue Creation:** Uses post-processing techniques to modify code generated by the deep-seek model to introduce logical issues.
- **Operator Modification:** Randomly modifies certain operators n a given code snippet to create logical issues. This includes comparison, arithmetic, and logical operators.



### Custom Sampling Implementation

- **Removing Top Probability Value:**
  - Removes the top probability value and samples from the remaining tokens, ensuring that the selected token is not the highest probability one.
- **Second Highest Probability Value:**
  - Samples using the second highest probability value, introducing controlled variations in the generated code.
